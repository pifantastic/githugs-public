## free hugs for hard working open source devs

### What do I do with it?
Sign up for githugs and the githugs github user will start leaving you encouraging messages on your github commits. [example](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/commit/7a984c7f84c8f287a05d035c295fc2086be4653b#comments)

The actual githugs repo contains sensitive information (github token, etc.), so this is a public mirror of that repo with sensitive information removed.

Excuse the mess, it was originally a node.js app that I quickly ported to PHP.  Fortunately, it was a snap to port and deploy with [http://orchestra.io/](http://orchestra.io/) ;)
