# githu.gs
## free hugs for hard working open source devs

[githugs.orchestra.io](http://githugs.orchestra.io/ "githugs") ([githu.gs](http://githu.gs/) if the domain would propagate)

### What do I do with it?
githugs will randomly choose one person a day to hug on github ([example](https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/commit/7a984c7f84c8f287a05d035c295fc2086be4653b#comments)). Just add your name and wait for hugs!

The actual githugs repo contains sensitive information (github token, etc.), so this is a public mirror of that repo with sensitive information removed.

Githugs was originally a node.js app that I quickly ported to PHP.  Fortunately, it was a snap to port and deploy with [http://orchestra.io/](http://orchestra.io/) ;)
